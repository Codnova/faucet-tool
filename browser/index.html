<h1 class="center">HNS Address Generator</h1>
<p class="generate">This tool generates the first receiving address, in the
first account of a BIP44 HD wallet. It also generates the 24 word BIP39 mnemonic
phrase which was used to seed the wallet.&nbsp;<strong>It is important that you keep
this seed phrase private. It is the only way to access your wallet. Do not share
your seed phrase with anyone that should not have access to the contents of
the wallet.</strong></p>

<p>This tool also generates the specific keypair used to derive the receiving address.
The keypair could instead be included in a multisig address. This repo includes a cli
tool which offers multisig support as well as support for testnet, regtest, and simnet
address generation.</p>
